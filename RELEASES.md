# RELEASES.md - what each release shipped and how it was verified

The per-release records moved out of `AGENTS.md` (which had grown past the
workspace instruction budget and was being truncated). `AGENTS.md` keeps the
release PROCESS; this file keeps the RESULT of each release: tag, staged
artifact hashes, gate results, what was deployed and how it was verified live.

Newest first.

  **RELEASED as 0.6.25** - tag `v0.6.25` on the release commit (the curated entry
  and the build fix live in it), staged artifacts in `dist/release/`
  (`NightSeam-0.6.25.zip` + `NightSeam-latest.zip` + `version.json` +
  `ns-version.js`), `check_release.py` 0 errors, the FULL browser gate **19/19 on
  the staged build** (12 web + 7 desktop against the fresh exe), and after the
  upload the live site passes the read-only production smoke (**13/13**,
  `check_browser.py --web --prod-url https://nightseam.de/astro/`). Deployed:
  `/downloads/` (zip, latest, version.json, ns-version.js), `/astro` (whole tree,
  index.html last) and the landing (with the regenerated changelog.json). The gate
  needs ONE unsandboxed command (Chromium's mojo named pipes); sandboxed, `TO-02`
  makes it report exit 2 honestly instead of a fake "failed check(s)".
- **RELEASED as 0.6.26** - tag `v0.6.26` on the release commit (`d412998` catalog
  rebuild + `ea86a3a` the curated entry), staged `dist/release/`
  (`NightSeam-0.6.26.zip` sha256 `cd0d2bc5...` + `NightSeam-latest.zip` +
  `version.json` + `ns-version.js`), `check_release.py` **0 errors at the tag**,
  the FULL browser gate **19/19 on the staged build** and **13/13 including the
  read-only production smoke** after the upload. Deployed `/downloads/` (zip,
  latest, exe, version.json, ns-version.js), `/astro` (whole tree, index.html
  last) and the landing. Verified live, not assumed: `/astro/version.json` +
  `/downloads/version.json` + `/downloads/ns-version.js` all read 0.6.26, the
  deployed `catalog.json` sha256 equals the local payload, the published zip
  equals the staged artifact, the live tokens are `app.js?v=70` /
  `CATALOG_TOKEN = 5`, and the live copy reads 12,160 with no stale "197".
  Follow-up commit `408dab5` regenerated the tracked `landing/changelog.json`
  (**never moved the tag**).
- **RELEASED as 0.6.27** - tag `v0.6.27` on the release commit (`348b015` the
  popularity/label/migration work + `b7cf4de` the curated entry), staged
  `dist/release/` (`NightSeam-0.6.27.zip` sha256 `383faa68...` + latest +
  `version.json` + `ns-version.js`), `check_release.py` **0 errors at the tag**,
  the FULL browser gate **19/19 on the staged build** and **13/13 including the
  read-only production smoke** after the upload. Deployed `/downloads/`,
  `/astro` (index.html last) and the landing; verified live (`/astro/version.json`
  + `/downloads/version.json` + `ns-version.js` = 0.6.27, the deployed
  `catalog.json` sha256 equals the local payload, the published zip equals the
  staged artifact). Follow-up commit `f816a00` regenerated the tracked
  `landing/changelog.json` (**never moved the tag**).
- **RELEASED as 0.6.28** - tag `v0.6.28` on the release commit (`4bcbcd9` the
  7-object supplement + the CATALOG.md/DECISIONS.md docs, `e3bcb38` the curated
  entry), staged `dist/release/` (`NightSeam-0.6.28.zip` sha256 `57b47519...` +
  latest + `version.json` + `ns-version.js`), `check_release.py` **0 errors at the
  tag**, the FULL browser gate **19/19 on the staged build** and **13/13 including
  the read-only production smoke** after the upload. Deployed `/downloads/`,
  `/astro` (index.html last) and the landing; verified live (`/astro/version.json`
  + `/downloads/version.json` + `ns-version.js` = 0.6.28, the deployed
  `catalog.json` equals the local payload AND carries all seven supplement ids,
  the published zip equals the staged artifact). Follow-up commit `f45b1d0`
  regenerated the tracked `landing/changelog.json` (**never moved the tag**).
  **Gate note:** the first `--all` run on the freshly built onefile exe failed
  `desktop-pano-crop-fov` with a 30 s wait timeout (32.5 s) because PyInstaller
  unpacks the ~20 MB exe to %TEMP% on first launch; the immediate re-run passed
  7/7 (3.1 s). A cold-start timeout right after a build is that, not a regression -
  re-run the gate before investigating.
